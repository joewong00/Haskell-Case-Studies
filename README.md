# Haskell-Case-Studies

## Case Study 1 : Caesar Cipher Code Cracker

The aim of this case study is to write a **Haskell** program that can automatically decode **Caesar Cipher** messages, by using **letter frequencies** to determine the most likely shift factor that was used to encode the message. For more info check out the [documentation](casestudy1.pdf).

## Case Study 2: String Transmitter
The goal of this case study is to write a **Haskell** script that simulates the transmission of a string of characters as a list of bits. For more info check out the [documentation](casestudy2.pdf)

## Case Study 3: Tautology Checker
The goal of this case study is to write a **Haskell** script that uses **truth tables** to decide if logical propositions are true for all possible values of their variables, i.e. if they are tautologies. For more info check out the [documentation](casestudy3.pdf)

## Case Study 4: Vote Systems
The goal of this case study is to write a **Haskell** script that simulates the **First Past the Post** system and the **Alternative Vote** system for the general election. For more info check out the [documentation](case4.pdf)
